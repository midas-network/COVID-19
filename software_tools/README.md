### [NobBS: Nowcasting by Bayesian Smoothing](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/663823)
* Curation status: published
* Created by: McGough S (sfm341@mail.harvard.edu), Johansson M (mjohansson@cdc.gov), Lipsitch M (mlipsitc@hsph.harvard.edu), Menzies N (nmenzies@hsph.harvard.edu) 
* Description: NobBS is Bayesian approach to estimate the number of occurred-but-not-yet-reported cases from incomplete, time-stamped reporting data for disease outbreaks. NobBS learns the reporting delay distribution and the time evolution of the epidemic curve to produce smoothed nowcasts in both stable and time-varying case reporting settings.

### [A stochastic model for the transmission of 2019-nCov in Wuhan](http://2019-coronavirus-tracker.com/stochastic.html)
* Curation status: published
* Created by: The Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) at the University of Georgia
* Description: Stochastic model to better understand the transmission of 2019-nCov in Hubei (primarily Wuhan). The model includes several features of the Wuhan outbreak that are absent from most compartmental models that otherwise confound the interpretation of data, including time-varying rates of case detection, patient isolation, and case notification.
